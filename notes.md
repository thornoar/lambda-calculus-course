# Main course
- focus on theoretical aspects, skip efficiency
- introduce eta reduction in problems (does not influence Church-Rosser)
- leave gaps in the `pre` function for a problem
- Definitions of recursive functions after types (theory + as problems)
- types before the power of lambda
- Define V, FV, BV, Sub in one batch
- lambda-definition of FV? (exercise)

# Haskell seminar
- Parser from and to the formal notation
- Lambda term representation
- Conversion, reduction
- List shift function
